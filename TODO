TODO

[ ] parsing, then changing the flag markers and re-parsing: will this
    work? make it work.
[ ] enable use of boost::lexical_cast and/or libfmt when available (with
    cpp macros).
[ ] when accepting unrecognized flags, then recognize "-hX" (for a bare
    flag "-h") as an unrecognized flag "-X" at pos N, subpos 2.
[ ] related to above, add a subpos data member to BasicArg.
[ ] universal to collect unknown args AND flags
